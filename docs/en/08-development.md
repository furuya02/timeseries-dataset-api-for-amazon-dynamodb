## 8.2 Lambda (cdk/lambda/api)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Lambda entry point. Accepts both REST API (payload 1.0) and function URL (2.0) events |
| `app.ts` | `createApi()`. Path routing, cache, structured logs. Receives its dependencies (settings, DynamoDB client, cache, logger, clock) |
| `request.ts` | Validation of `/query` parameters |
| `key-condition.ts` | Partition key values, sort key ranges, reading times |
| `reader.ts` | Query API paging, parallel execution, truncation by limits |
| `transform.ts` | Column selection, ProjectionExpression, type conversion |
| `aggregate.ts` | Aggregation and output format (long / wide) |
| `response.ts` | Building the response and checking its size |
| `catalog.ts` | `/datasets` and `/keys` |
| `cache.ts` | Response cache (TTL, byte limit) |
| `time.ts` | Time zone calculations (no external library) |
| `types.ts` / `errors.ts` / `rows.ts` | Shared types, errors, row ordering |

Design principles:

- Only the DynamoDB Query API is used (no Scan). Flexibility comes from `datasets.yaml`
- Settings are validated at synth time and bundled with the Lambda function as `datasets.generated.json` (environment variables are not used because of their 4KB limit)
- The DynamoDB client is received through the `QueryClient` interface and replaced with a fake in tests
- The only external library is the AWS SDK. The AWS SDK is not bundled; the one included in the Lambda runtime is used

## 8.3 CDK (cdk/lib)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `config.ts` | `datasets.yaml` schema (zod), applying defaults, showing errors |
| `options.ts` | Validation of deployment options (`-c`) |
| `timeseries-dataset-api-stack.ts` | Stack |
| `api-function.ts` / `endpoint.ts` / `grafana-access.ts` / `sample-table.ts` | Lambda, entry point for each exposure type, IAM for Grafana, sample table |

Each building block creates resources directly with the stack as scope, not as a child construct. This keeps the logical IDs unchanged (if they change, the log group and the API are recreated in existing environments). For changes to the resource structure, write in the CHANGELOG whether resources are replaced.

## 8.4 Development setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint          # Biome (lint and format check)
pnpm format        # format with Biome
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript (cdk and scripts)
```

## 8.5 Tests

| Command | Content | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm test` | Unit tests (cdk and scripts) and CDK template tests | None |
| `pnpm test:integration` | Integration tests with DynamoDB Local | DynamoDB Local |
| `pnpm coverage` | Coverage (cdk unit + integration) | DynamoDB Local |

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local:3.3.2 -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -inMemory
pnpm test:integration
```

| Location | Content |
|---|---|
| `cdk/test/unit` | Validation of the Lambda function and the settings. DynamoDB is a fake client (`fakeClient`) |
| `cdk/test/cdk` | Validates the template with `aws-cdk-lib/assertions` (combinations of exposure type and authentication, scope of IAM permissions) |
| `cdk/test/integration` | Creates tables in DynamoDB Local (`global-setup.ts`) and checks behavior through `createApi()` |
| `scripts/test` | Inference, data source settings generation, signed calls, sample data generation |

Testing principles:

- Add unit tests for new settings and parameters. If they depend on DynamoDB behavior, also add integration tests
- CDK tests save and restore `datasets.generated.json`, which is rewritten on every synth, before and after the tests
- The DynamoDB Local endpoint for integration tests is `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB` (default `http://localhost:8000`)

## 8.6 Run the API locally

```bash
docker compose -f grafana/docker-compose.yml --profile local up -d
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB=http://localhost:8000 AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=local AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=local
pnpm seed --create
pnpm local-api                                   # http://localhost:13000/
pnpm check --endpoint http://localhost:13000
```

`pnpm local-api` runs the same `createApi()` as the Lambda function in an HTTP server without authentication.

## 8.7 CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the following on push (main) and on PRs.

| Job | Content |
|---|---|
| check (Node.js 22 / 24) | `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm cdk-synth` (no AWS credentials) |
| integration | `pnpm test:integration` with DynamoDB Local (services) |

Dependabot proposes updates once a week for npm dependencies (AWS SDK, AWS CDK, and development tools grouped together), GitHub Actions, and docker-compose images.

## 8.8 Release

1. Change Unreleased in `CHANGELOG.md` to a heading with the version and date
2. Bump `version` in the root and each package's `package.json` ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Changes that break configuration file compatibility are major)
3. Merge into main, add a tag such as `v0.2.0`, and create a GitHub release

## 8.9 Test on AWS

If a change affects AWS behavior (IAM, exposure type, logs, etc.), deploy it to your own account and test it.

```bash
pnpm cdk-deploy -c sample=true -c grafanaUser=true
pnpm seed && pnpm check
# clean up after testing (delete the access key first)
pnpm cdk-destroy -c sample=true -c grafanaUser=true
```

IAM changes can take a few minutes to take effect. If you switch the permissions of the same principal while testing, the results are inconsistent, so when you compare permission combinations, use a separate IAM user for each combination.
